In a world of code so vast,
C language stands, a classic past.
With pointers sharp and syntax clear,
It brings low-level magic near.

Functions, structs, and arrays too,
Crafting logic, old yet new.
From Kernighan and Ritchie’s mind,
A tool for coders, so refined.

In every loop and if’s embrace,
C’s elegance we can trace.
Though new languages may arise,
C’s foundation never dies.

So here’s to C, both strong and free,
A timeless gem in programming’s sea.
